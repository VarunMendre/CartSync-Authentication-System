#CartSync Authentication System

#A mini project that demonstrates how modern e-commerce platforms like Amazon handle guest sessions, persistent carts, and automatic cart merging after login.

🚀 #Overview

#CartSync Authentication System allows a user to browse the site without logging in, add items to the cart, close the browser, revisit the site, and still retain the same guest cart.
#When the user finally logs in, the system merges the guest cart with their authenticated user cart.

✨ #Features

#Guest session creation on first visit
#Persistent cart for non-logged-in users
#Cart stored in database / cache / cookie (configurable)
#Automatic cart merge after authentication
#Basic login & registration system
#Clean REST API structure
